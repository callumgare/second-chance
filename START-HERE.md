# Second Chance - Swift Implementation

## ⚠️ Important: Initial Setup Required

The Xcode project needs to be created properly using Xcode itself (Xcode project files are complex and need to be generated by Xcode).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Create the Xcode Project

**Follow the instructions in:**

📖 **[SecondChance/SETUP.md](SecondChance/SETUP.md)**

This will guide you through:
1. Creating a new Xcode project
2. Adding all the Swift files
3. Configuring the project settings
4. Building and running

**Estimated time:** 5-10 minutes

### Step 2: Follow the Checklist

Once the project is set up, see:

📋 **[SecondChance/CHECKLIST.md](SecondChance/CHECKLIST.md)**

This covers:
- Bundling Wine framework
- Testing the installation
- Adding resources

## 📚 Full Documentation

After setup, explore the comprehensive guides:

- **[OVERVIEW.md](SecondChance/OVERVIEW.md)** - Complete project overview
- **[README.md](SecondChance/README.md)** - Architecture and features
- **[QUICKSTART.md](SecondChance/QUICKSTART.md)** - Developer guide
- **[MIGRATION.md](SecondChance/MIGRATION.md)** - Bash to Swift conversion
- **[CACHING.md](SecondChance/CACHING.md)** - Caching system details
- **[TODO.md](SecondChance/TODO.md)** - Roadmap and tasks

## 🎯 What This Is

A complete rewrite of the Nancy Drew game wrapper tool from bash/Platypus to native Swift/SwiftUI.

**Features:**
- ✅ Native macOS UI with SwiftUI
- ✅ Complete game database (30+ games)
- ✅ Intelligent game detection
- ✅ Wine integration framework
- ✅ Advanced caching system
- ✅ ~3,500 lines of well-structured code
- ✅ ~3,000 lines of documentation

## 🔄 Why the Setup Step?

Xcode project files (`.pbxproj`) are complex binary property lists that change frequently and are best managed by Xcode itself. Creating them manually often leads to parse errors (as you experienced).

The setup process uses Xcode to generate a proper project file, then you add the Swift source files we've created.

## ⏱️ Time Investment

- **Setup:** 5-10 minutes (following SETUP.md)
- **Reading docs:** 30-60 minutes (optional but recommended)
- **Adding Wine:** 10-30 minutes (depends on where you get Wine)
- **First test:** 5-10 minutes

**Total to working app:** ~1-2 hours

## 🎮 What Works Right Now

After setup:
- ✅ App compiles and runs
- ✅ Welcome screen with UI
- ✅ File/folder pickers work
- ✅ Game detection logic
- ✅ Installation orchestration
- 🚧 Needs Wine framework to actually install games

## 🍷 Next: Adding Wine

After Xcode setup, the critical next step is bundling the Wine framework. See CHECKLIST.md for options:

1. Copy from CrossOver
2. Extract from Wineskin wrapper
3. Download pre-built Wine

## 💬 Support

All questions answered in the documentation:

- **How do I...?** → Check QUICKSTART.md
- **What's this file?** → See OVERVIEW.md
- **How does this compare to bash?** → Read MIGRATION.md
- **What's left to do?** → Look at TODO.md
